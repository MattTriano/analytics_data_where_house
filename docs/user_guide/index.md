# User's Guide

This system comes with a number of already-built ELT data pipelines that you can run to stock your data warehouse. This [User's Guide](/user_guide) shows how to start up the system, unpause and trigger a pipeline, and how to [create charts and dashboards](visualization/index.md) from the data in your warehouse.

To add a pipeline for new data set, see the [Developer's Guide](/dev_guide/).
